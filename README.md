This article presents a study conducted on the quality and functionality of research code available in the Harvard Dataverse repository, which is often shared alongside academic papers to enhance research transparency and reproducibility. The study addresses ten key questions related to factors influencing research reproducibility and code reuse. In the study, over 2,000 replication datasets containing more than 9,000 unique R files, published between 2010 and 2020, were retrieved and analyzed. Subsequently, the code was executed in a clean runtime environment to assess its usability. The analysis revealed common coding errors, some of which were resolved through automated code cleaning to facilitate code execution. The findings showed that initially, 74% of R files encountered errors during execution, and even with code cleaning applied, 56% still had issues, underscoring the importance of adhering to good coding practices. Additionally, the study examined replication datasets from various journals and discussed how the strictness of journal policies influenced the success rate of code re-execution. Finally, based on the research outcomes, the article proposes recommendations for improving code dissemination, targeting researchers, journals, and repositories

Over the past ten years, the primary focus has been on exploring innovative methods for managing technical debt. I have delivered numerous presentations on the subject of technical debt and authored two books dedicated to achieving success in large-scale software projects. The work has afforded me the opportunity to collaborate with a wide range of organizations worldwide, from which It have gained valuable insights.
Moreover, having a deep understanding of your code's health offers several benefits, including risk reduction, clearer alignment of expectations, and increased empowerment of development teams. When you possess insights into your code's health, you can leverage this information when planning and prioritizing features. For instance, if you identify "Red Code" during planning, it signifies that the associated feature carries a) higher risk, b) greater development time requirements, and c) a higher level of uncertainty regarding completion time.
