# A large-scale study on research code quality and execution
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01143-6

This article presents a study conducted on the quality and functionality of research code available in the Harvard Dataverse repository, which is often shared alongside academic papers to enhance research transparency and reproducibility. The study addresses ten key questions related to factors influencing research reproducibility and code reuse. In the study, over 2,000 replication datasets containing more than 9,000 unique R files, published between 2010 and 2020, were retrieved and analyzed. Subsequently, the code was executed in a clean runtime environment to assess its usability. The analysis revealed common coding errors, some of which were resolved through automated code cleaning to facilitate code execution. The findings showed that initially, 74% of R files encountered errors during execution, and even with code cleaning applied, 56% still had issues, underscoring the importance of adhering to good coding practices. Additionally, the study examined replication datasets from various journals and discussed how the strictness of journal policies influenced the success rate of code re-execution. Finally, based on the research outcomes, the article proposes recommendations for improving code dissemination, targeting researchers, journals, and repositories

Over the past ten years, the primary focus has been on exploring innovative methods for managing technical debt. I have delivered numerous presentations on the subject of technical debt and authored two books dedicated to achieving success in large-scale software projects. The work has afforded me the opportunity to collaborate with a wide range of organizations worldwide, from which It have gained valuable insights.
Moreover, having a deep understanding of your code's health offers several benefits, including risk reduction, clearer alignment of expectations, and increased empowerment of development teams. When you possess insights into your code's health, you can leverage this information when planning and prioritizing features. For instance, if you identify "Red Code" during planning, it signifies that the associated feature carries a) higher risk, b) greater development time requirements, and c) a higher level of uncertainty regarding completion time.

# Identification of strategies over tools for static code analysis
https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/1163/1/012012/meta

This article discusses the growing utilization of static code analysis tools to enhance the quality of source code, emphasizing its pivotal role in software product development, necessitating continuous monitoring and examination. Static code analysis serves as a reliable means to deduce program behavior without its actual execution. A multitude of tools are available for static analysis, tailored to various 
frameworks, programming languages, and defect detection in source code. While different strategies for employing static code analysis tools exist, they have not been systematically categorized. The paper presents an experiment that evaluates various tools and their integration within the standard code review process. It identifies distinct strategies for utilizing these tools and outlines the essential steps for 
their successful implementation. Users are encouraged to select one of these strategies and follow the prescribed steps when integrating the tool into their workflow.

# Adopting PHP code quality tooling to make life as a WordPress developer much more enjoyable.

WordPress's widespread popularity is attributed to its flexibility and the ease with which developers can create using it. However, beneath the surface of a typical WordPress site, the subpar code quality in many of the 50+ plugins or the site's theme often goes unnoticed. This hidden issue can manifest in slow-loading or glitchy pages, impacting user experience. Site owners may also experience financial repercussions, as they may need to invest in more powerful servers to accommodate these increasingly resource-intensive sites.

# comparison of all the Articles
Comparing all the articles the outcome is that these articles collectively stress the importance of code quality in diverse contexts, including research, business impact, software development, and website performance. They highlight the need for proper coding practices, tools, and strategies to ensure the delivery of high-quality and reliable software solutions.

# Summary checklist of the above articles are :-
1.Recognising the impact of journal policies on code re-execution.
2.Empower development teams through code health insights.
3.Utilization of static code analysis tools.
4.Clear Alignment of expectations.
5.User experience and server performance 
6.Aligning all the expectations.

# Comaparision between the both links provided.
1.Never Allow the bad code with good comments.
2.The units of the code should be testable.
3.Code should be easy to read and understandable.

#comparing my checklit with checklist with links
1.The provided checklist items seem to focus on a broader perspective of understanding code quality implications, including the impact on users, development teams, and alignment of expectations.
2.The code review checklist items from the comparison mainly emphasize writing good, readable, and testable code, with a particular emphasis on not masking poor code with good comments.

# Revising the points
1.Code should be understable and easy to acesss.

I would like to give myself 3 out of 4.
